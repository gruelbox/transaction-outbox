     * pipeline such as a FIFO queue or Kafka topic, or for reliable data replication, such as when
     * feeding a data warehouse or distributed cache.
     *
     * <p>Note that using this option has a number of consequences:
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>Requests are not processed immediately when submitting a request, as normal, and are
     *       processed by {@link TransactionOutbox#flush()} only. As a result there will be
     *       increased delay between the source transaction being committed and the request being
     *       processed.
     *   <li>If a request fails, no further requests will be processed <em>in that topic</em> until
     *       a subsequent retry allows the failing request to succeed, to preserve ordered
     *       processing. This means it is possible for topics to become entirely frozen in the event
     *       that a request fails repeatedly. For this reason, it is essential to use a {@link
     *       TransactionOutboxListener} to watch for failing requests and investigate quickly. Note
     *       that other topics will be unaffected.
     *   <lI>For the same reason, {@link TransactionOutboxBuilder#blockAfterAttempts} is ignored for
     *       all requests that use this option. The only safe way to recover from a failing request
     *       is to make the request succeed.
     *   <li>A single topic can only be processed in single-threaded fashion, so if your requests
     *       use a small number of topics, scalability will be affected since the degree of
     *       parallelism will be reduced.
     *   <li>Throughput is significantly reduced and database load increased more generally, even
     *       with larger numbers of topics, since records are only processed one-at-a-time rather
     *       than in batches, which is less optimised.
     *   <li>In general, <a
     *       href="https://shermanonsoftware.com/2019/09/04/your-database-is-not-a-queue/">databases
     *       are not well optimised for this sort of thing</a>. Don't expect miracles. If you need
     *       more throughput, you probably need to think twice about your architecture. Consider the
     *       <a href="https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html">event sourcing
     *       pattern</a>, for example, where the message queue is the primary data store rather than
