/**
 * Schedules background work using a local {@link Executor} implementation. Note that the {@link
 * Runnable}s submitted to this will not be {@link java.io.Serializable} so will not be suitable for
 * remoting. Remote submission of work is not yet supported.
 *
 * <p>Note that there are some important aspects that should be considered in the configuration of
 * this executor:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Should use a BOUNDED blocking queue implementation such as {@link ArrayBlockingQueue},
 *       otherwise under high volume, the queue may get so large it causes out-of-memory errors.
 *   <li>Should use a {@link java.util.concurrent.RejectedExecutionHandler} which either throws
 *       (such as {@link java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy}), silently fails (such
 *       as {@link java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardPolicy}) or blocks the calling
 *       thread until a thread is available. It should <strong>not</strong> execute the work in the
 *       calling thread (e.g. {@link java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy},
 *       since this could result in unpredictable effects with tasks assuming they will be run in a
 *       different thread context corrupting thread state. Generally, throwing or silently failing
 *       are preferred since this allows the database to absorb all backpressure, but if you have a
 *       strong reason to choose a blocking policy to enforce upstream backpressure, be aware that
 *       {@link TransactionOutbox#flush()} can potentially block for a long period of time too, so
 *       design any background processing which calls it accordingly (e.g. avoid calling from a
 *       timed scheduled job; perhaps instead simply loop it).
 *   <li>The queue can afford to be quite large in most realistic production deployments, and it is
 *       advised that it be so (10000+).
 * </ul>
