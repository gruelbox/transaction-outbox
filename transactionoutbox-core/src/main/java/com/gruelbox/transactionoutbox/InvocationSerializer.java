/**
 * {@link Invocation} objects are inherently difficult to serialize safely since they are
 * unpredictably polymorphic. Allowing them to contain <em>any</em> type reference opens you up to a
 * host of code injection attacks. At the same time, allowing possibly-unstable types into
 * serialized {@link Invocation}s can result in compatibility issues, with still unprocessed entries
 * in the database containing older versions of your classes. To avoid this, it makes sense to
 * specify the types supported and restrict this set of serializable classes to known-stable types
 * such as primitives and common JDK value types. {@link #createDefaultJsonSerializer()} provides
 * exactly this and is used by default. However, if you want to extend this list or use a different
 * serialization format, you can create your own implementation here, at your own risk.
